        "question": "Which of the following best defines a 'project' according to PRINCE2?",
        "options": {
            "a": "A routine operation or ongoing activity that produces a standard output.",
            "b": "A temporary organization created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to an agreed Business Case.",
            "c": "A collection of ongoing activities managed by a permanent team to achieve strategic objectives.",
            "d": "Any work that involves a budget and a deadline."
        },
        "answer": "b",
        "reasoning": "PRINCE2 defines a project as a temporary organization with a specific purpose and lifecycle, distinguishing it from permanent, ongoing business operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT one of the five characteristics that distinguish a project from 'business as usual' (BAU) in PRINCE2?",
        "options": {

            "d": "Unique."
        },
        "answer": "c",
        "reasoning": "Projects are temporary and unique, not recurring. 'Recurring' is a characteristic of business as usual."

        "question": "A project is described as 'cross-functional' in PRINCE2 because it often involves which of the following?",
        "options": {
            "a": "Work that is carried out by a single, dedicated functional department.",
            "b": "Activities that bring little change to an organization.",
            "c": "Several groups of people from different functional divisions or even different organizations working together.",
            "d": "Tasks that are predictable and recurring within a single organizational structure."

            "d": "Benefits."
        },
        "answer": "c",
        "reasoning": "The six aspects are Costs, Timescales, Quality, Scope, Risk, and Benefits. Contracts are a mechanism for managing suppliers, not a core performance aspect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Benefits' aspect of project performance in PRINCE2?",
        "options": {
            "a": "To determine the duration over which the project will be executed.",
            "b": "To establish the objectives for the expected return on the project.",

            "d": "Business Case, Organization, Quality, and Plans."
        },
        "answer": "b",

        },
        "answer": "b",
        "reasoning": "PRINCE2 is a method, not a collection of specific techniques. It tells you what needs to be done, but not the detailed 'how' of specialist tools."

            "d": "That the project manager is solely responsible for project benefits."
        },
        "answer": "b",
        "reasoning": "This principle ensures that there is always a valid reason to continue with the project, and if the justification disappears, the project should be stopped."
    },

        "options": {
            "a": "That all project activities are completed on time.",
            "b": "That the project management team is clear about what outputs will be created and does no more work than necessary to deliver them.",

            "b": "The flexibility of PRINCE2 allows it to be adapted to the project's environment, size, complexity, importance, team capability, and risk.",
            "c": "All PRINCE2 recommended techniques must be used, regardless of project context.",
            "d": "Tailoring is solely the responsibility of the Project Board and does not involve the Project Manager."
        },
        "answer": "b",
        "reasoning": "Tailoring is a key principle that ensures the amount of project management applied is appropriate for the scale and nature of the project."
