* **Comprehensive Final Test:** Includes a special "Final Test" mode that algorithmically compiles a 60-question exam, guaranteeing at least one question from every topic week and filling the remainder randomly from the entire question pool.

* **Interactive Experience:** Features a countdown timer that changes color based on urgency, a live counter for answered questions, and smooth UI updates managed entirely with vanilla JavaScript.

* **Detailed Performance Analysis:** Upon completion, users receive an instant Pass/Fail result (based on an 85% threshold), a detailed breakdown of only the incorrect answers with official rationales, and a separate summary of all correct answers for review.

* **Clean & Responsive UI:** Built with a modern Flexbox layout that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a great user experience on any screen size.
